5.The only difference I see is the amount of money put in,Ticket 1 245353 cents and t2 is 2445.

6. public class Student      and       public class LabClass
{                                      {
    
7. The green doesnt cover anything below class public and the error message being 
<identifier expected> it is quite a vague explanation.

10. the fields are price, balance and total. The constructor is public TicketMachine.
Lastly methods being public int getPrice and public int getBalance

11. The box around the constructors appear yellow and the constructors always start with public
